MyList.h: contains the declaration of the MyList class.

MyList.cc: contains the implementation of the main class, MyList. MyList class
            objects are objects that contain a linked list of dynamically 
            allocated Node objects.
            
MyNode.h: contains the declaration and implementation of the Node class. Each 
            Node holds two pieces of information: 1) a single ASCII character 
            and 2) a pointer to a Node, which will point to the next Node in the 
            linked list of the MyList object.
            
main.cc: test harness for the MyList and Node classes. Checks the functionality
            of all member functions of the MyList class.
