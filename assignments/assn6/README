main.cc: includes heapSort function, which is used to implement the heap
		 sort algorithm in a vector. I decided to have this single function
		 do everything, as opposed to calling other functions to make it more
		 readable. I did this since I wasn't sure if we were allowed to split it
		 up into several functions since the instructions do not specify whether
		 it wants a single function or not. Preferably, I would have liked to
		 split it up.
