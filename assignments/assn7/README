main.cc: My own test harness to test the implementation of my prim function.

prim.h: contains my prim function to return the Minimal Spanning Tree as a 
		Graph(set of edges). Also contains a simple hashtable class to group
		edges with similiar vertices in the same hashtable index. Uses chaining
		for this programs implementation.
		
final: A file used to quickly initialize a graph full of edges and respectives
		weights in my test harness.
